# About the Bot

This is mostly started out as a hobby and as an idea mainly to replicate the actual hunter's hournal from Team Cherry's videogame: _Hollow Knight._

This bot has only 2-5 commands at the moment and more are coming in the future. If you would like to directly support me you can donate to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/redlagoon) or if you would like to ask some questions or even suggest new features, there will be a support server coming soon. Thank you.
